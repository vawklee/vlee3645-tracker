Packages, npm install: Parcel

## To-Do [Delete later]
- default empty state: notification to get users to add books
- change sidebar widths and heights to vw and vh, more responsive
- dropshadow for items
- floating action button for showing the form

## Method of approach
1. Worked on creating basic HTML layout
2. 

## Testing
### Browsers used for testing and viewing
- Google Chrome
- Microsoft Edge
- Mozilla Firefox

### Screen sizes used
- Laptop screen: 1920 x 1080
- PC screen: 3840 x 2160
- Mobile screen: TBC

## User testing (optional)

## Things to improve
- Using a book cover API to generate the books' thumbnails rather than being determined by genre
- A more extensive list of languages, sourced from https://www.dynamiclanguage.com/list-of-languages/ but the time constraints for this code haven't allowed me to integrate that list
