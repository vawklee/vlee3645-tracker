DECO2017 Assignment 3 - Media Consumption (Books) Tracker
*I logged in on the wrong account at one point, sorry.*

## To-Do [Delete later]
- some issue where starting on a new browser breaks the localbook array, returning null
- sometimes the form submits items twice
- click to view items
- hover over items colour change
- source images for thumbnails
- default empty state: notification to get users to add books
- change sidebar widths and heights to vw and vh, more responsive

## Method of approach
1. Worked on creating basic HTML layout
2. Added CSS gradually to new elements created in HTML
3. Added JS for the elements bit by bit

### Creating the pop-up form
1. Wrote out the HTML for all the form elements
2. General CSS for spacing of input boxes
3. Scripted the 'Add book' and 'Cancel' buttons
4. Currently solving issues with having the form show up and disappear

## Testing
### Browsers used for testing and viewing
- Google Chrome
- Microsoft Edge
- Mozilla Firefox

### Screen sizes used
- Laptop screen: 1920 x 1080
- PC screen: 3840 x 2160
- Mobile screen: TBC

## User testing (optional)

## Things to improve
- Due to time constraints for this assignment, thumbnails were determined by the format of the book being added to the tracker rather than using the genres; there were just too many genres to count
- Using a book cover API to generate the books' thumbnails rather than being determined by genre
- A more extensive list of languages, sourced from https://www.dynamiclanguage.com/list-of-languages/ but the time constraints for this code haven't allowed me to integrate that list
