## To-Do [Delete later]
- thumbnail images are not showing up
- default empty state: notification to get users to add books
- change sidebar widths and heights to vw and vh, more responsive
- dropshadow for items
- floating action button for showing the form
- displaying form css is not working currently

## Method of approach
1. Worked on creating basic HTML layout
2. Added CSS gradually to new elements created in HTML
3. Added JS for the elements bit by bit

### Creating the pop-up form
1. Wrote out the HTML for all the form elements
2. General CSS for spacing of input boxes
3. Scripted the 'Add book' and 'Cancel' buttons
4. Currently solving issues with having the form show up and disappear

## Testing
### Browsers used for testing and viewing
- Google Chrome
- Microsoft Edge
- Mozilla Firefox

### Screen sizes used
- Laptop screen: 1920 x 1080
- PC screen: 3840 x 2160
- Mobile screen: TBC

## User testing (optional)

## Things to improve
- Using a book cover API to generate the books' thumbnails rather than being determined by genre
- A more extensive list of languages, sourced from https://www.dynamiclanguage.com/list-of-languages/ but the time constraints for this code haven't allowed me to integrate that list
